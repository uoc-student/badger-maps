I chose to use databases because:
1. Databases will implement any query in the best way possible.
2. The code becomes easier to read.
3. Better handling of exceptions.
4. Better handling of special data (such as dates).
5. It has a relatively smaller footprint and is extremely scalable in the long run.


Since I work on ArchLinux I chose MariaDB which is the default implementation of
MySQL, the following credentials are granted to badger maps in order to 
establish connection:
host: localhost
user: badger
password: maps
database: badger_db
