Although the use of databases is not mandatory for this task, I chose to use them because:
1. Databases will implement any query in the best way possible.
2. The code becomes easier to read.
3. Better handling of exceptions.
4. It has a relatively smaller footprint and is extremely scalable in the long run.


Since I work on ArchLinux I chose MariaDB which is the default implementation of
MySQL, the following credentials are granted to badger maps in order to 
establish connection:
host: localhost
user: badger
password: maps
